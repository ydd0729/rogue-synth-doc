# Game Design Document: Brick-Control Survivor-Like Game

## 1. Project Overview

This project is an **action game** based on a **Survivor-like “lawn mowing” gameplay**. The core mechanic is that the player **controls floor tiles to activate skills**. Unlike traditional weapon attacks, all player attacks, traps, and defenses rely on the tile system.

Within a **6-week development cycle**, we aim to deliver a **playable prototype** featuring:
- A basic skill system
- Enemy spawning and survival mechanics
- At least 2–3 skill branches
- Visual, audio, and gameplay content generation to meet course grading requirements

## 2. Gameplay Design

### 2.1 Core Mechanics
- The game world is composed of **floor tiles**.
- Skills are deployed via tiles, for example:
  - **Wave attacks using tiles**
  - **Summoning tiles to strike enemies**
  - **Enchanted tiles causing additional effects**
  - **Removing tiles to create traps**
- Elite enemies or bosses can also manipulate or destroy tiles.
- Players must **survive waves of enemies**, gaining experience by defeating foes to **unlock or upgrade skills**.

### 2.2 Skills and Upgrade Paths
Multiple skill branches are designed to ensure **diversity and progression**:

1. **Wave Attack Branch (partially implemented)**
   - Base: Fan-shaped wave attack gradually expanding
   - Upgrade 1: Increases attack angle
   - Upgrade 2: Increases attack range
   - Upgrade 3: Multi-wave consecutive release

2. **Enchantment Branch**
   - Base: Wave attacks imbued with fire or ice attributes
   - Upgrade 1: Fire causes burning, ice causes slowing
   - Upgrade 2: Extended enchantment duration or chance to trigger extra effects

3. **Summoning Tile Attack Branch**
   - Base: Manipulate floor tiles to fly and hit enemies
   - Upgrade 1: Increase number of tiles
   - Upgrade 2: Tiles grow in size when launched
   - Upgrade 3: Tiles explode causing area damage

4. **Trap Branch**
   - Base: Remove tiles to form traps that damage enemies
   - Upgrade 1: Increase trap area
   - Upgrade 2: Traps have secondary explosions or special effects

## 3. Alignment with Grading Criteria

Course grading (out of 50 points) includes:

1. **Successful integration of generators across 3 content types (10 pts)**
   - 3D Models & Animations: Enemy and player models
   - Image Generation: Upgrade card visuals
   - Music Generation: Background music
   - Game Code Generation: Codex

2. **Creativity of the idea (10 pts)**
   - Core mechanic “tile control” differentiates from standard lawn-mowing games, ensuring originality

3. **Technical Difficulty (10 pts)**
   - Dynamic terrain, skill upgrade system, and integration of AI-generated content

4. **Presentation (10 pts)**
   - Demonstrate full loop: Generated characters → Combat → Skill upgrades → Survival
   - Explain integration of AI-generated content and gameplay

5. **Documentation (5 pts)**
   - Provide clear GDD, architecture overview, skill tables, and development logs

6. **Aesthetics (5 pts)**
   - Consistent art style; AI-generated assets processed for uniform visual quality

> This design aligns well with all grading criteria, with highlights in creativity and technical implementation.

## 4. Project Advantages and Challenges

**Advantages**
- Unique creativity: Core tile control differentiates from conventional lawn-mowing games
- AI-assisted acceleration: Codex and other AI tools help generate code and assets efficiently
- High scalability: Future skills, enemies, and levels can be added for sustainable development

**Challenges**
- Limited time (6 weeks): Scope control is essential to avoid overdesign
- Skill balance: Ensure different branches provide a complete gameplay experience
- AI content consistency: Human review required to maintain art and music style
- Team collaboration: Poor division of work could impact schedule

## 5. Timeline (6 Weeks)

| Week | Goal | Deliverable |
|------|------|------------|
| 1 | Project framework, basic scene & character implementation | Movable player, enemy prototype |
| 2 | Core skill (Wave Attack) refinement | Playable demo |
| 3 | New skills (Summoning Tile, Trap) implementation | At least 2 playable skill branches |
| 4 | AI-generated content integration (art, animation, music) | Replaceable assets and music |
| 5 | Skill upgrade system & UI completion | Fully playable upgrade paths |
| 6 | Tuning, testing, documentation, demo preparation | Final demonstrable prototype |

---

## 6. Future Expansion Potential

- Extend skill branches (e.g., defensive skills, summoning skills)
- Add **Roguelike elements**: procedural levels, equipment system
- Refine art and music style for potential independent game IP

---

## 7. Conclusion

This project demonstrates strong **creativity, playability, and alignment with grading criteria**.

The 6-week timeline is feasible for producing a **representative prototype**, with ample potential for future expansion, making it an ideal choice for the AICG course assignment.
