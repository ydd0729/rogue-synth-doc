# Brick Fury: AI-Assisted Unity Game Development

## 1. Overview

This project is a **Unity-based interactive game** that integrates multiple **generative AI tools** to assist in **narrative design**, **code generation**, **visual creation**, and **sound production**.

The goal of this project is to explore how AI can **enhance and accelerate** the process of game development while preserving **human creativity and technical control**.

The final product is a **3D Unity game** collaboratively developed by the team, with AI contributing to specific areas such as dialogue generation, asset creation, sound design, and performance optimization.

## 4. Workflow Summary

1. **Concept & Planning** â€” Brainstormed core ideas, storylines, and gameplay mechanics, assisted by *ChatGPT* for refining design concepts.
2. **AI Asset Generation** â€” Generated visuals, 3D models, and sound effects using *Hunyuan 3D*, *Doubao*, and *Stable Audio*.
3. **Unity Development** â€” Integrated AI-generated content into Unity; implemented logic, UI, and interactions using C# and Unity Editor.
4. **Testing & Polishing** â€” Conducted iterative testing to refine gameplay, UI, and performance, combining AI suggestions with manual optimization.

## 5. Reflections

Generative AI tools greatly streamlined the workflow by automating content creation and providing creative inspiration throughout development.

However, human creativity, aesthetic judgment, and gameplay sense remained crucial for achieving a cohesive and engaging experience.

AI served as a **creative collaborator** â€” enhancing productivity but not replacing artistry.
